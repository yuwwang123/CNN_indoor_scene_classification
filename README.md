# CNN_indoor_scene_classification

The training set and test set for this experiment consist of images of various room scenes from the
KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The experiment is based on training several neural network
models and deploying them to classify different room scenes. The effectiveness of 3 neural nets of different structures are compared.
